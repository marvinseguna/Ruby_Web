## Synopsis

Niko-niko calendar, also known as smiley calendar or happiness index, is a **tool used to track the mood of a team**. Nikoniko is Japanese ideophone for smiling. You set up a calendar, and each team member tracks his/her mood after each working day with a smiley. General smileys include; happy :-), straight :-| or frowning smiley :-(. In regular intervals (like e.g. in each retrospective), the team gathers to **analyse the tracking results**. Here are a few examples in a team with five members, where the average over the last period was as follows: 
* **one happy smiley, four frowning smileys** (or one frowning smiley and four happy smileys): What's going on here? Does the team have an outsider? Why is there such a big diversion?</li>
* **all frowning smileys**: Uh, bad karma in the team. Why? What is upsetting them?</li>
* **all happy smileys, and a broken sprint, angry customers, bad code, lots of bugs**: Why are they happy in the middle of a mess? Why don't they care about their work?</li>

Data from a Niko-niko calendar is a **huge opportunity for reflection**, and helps to retrieve feedback from changes like altering the environment immediately. Recent changes may indicate whether they were appreciated or not by each team member through the selected smileys. Niko-niko calendars are in many cases much faster when it comes to indicate problems. They are easily built and ready to use in almost no time.



## Motivation

This project was created by combining Sinatra with knockoutJS to create a basic Niko Niko calendar application (webpage). As explained in the section above, it is meant to be used by a group of team members to track mood swings along the day. This should help to better understand the preferred tasks by each team member, as well as providing an indication of the current team environment.
